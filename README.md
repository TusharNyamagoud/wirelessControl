A Raspberry Pi based RC motor toy , used JavaScript for frontend to capture user input and forward the request to the server.

The backend was a Python server that handled the incoming request using Sockets, The server parsed user input and based on that issued appropriate  commands to the Raspberry Pi GPIO to control the Motors.

P.S :
Unfortunately, the thumb drive used to host the OS for Raspberry was corrupted and the Python code was lost.
